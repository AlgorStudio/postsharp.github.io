<h1>Which package to download?</h1> 					<p>Since we provide five different packages, you may feel  					confused. Read on.</p> 					<h2>Windows Installer</h2> <p>If you want to install PostSharp globally and  						beneficiate from native images and help integration with  						Visual Studio, choose one of the <strong>Windows  						Installer (MSI)</strong> packages. We provide two  						versions: one for 32-bit operating systems, one for  						64-bit (AMD64) operating systems. Note that these  						packages are built in release mode, which means that  						tracing and preconditions have been filtered out.</p> 						  <h2>Binary Package</h2> 						<p>There are two good reasons to use a <strong>Binary  						Package</strong>:</p> 						<ol> 							<li>You can't install PostSharp  							globally because you don't have administrative  							rights.</li> 							<li>You plan to store PostSharp in your source  							repository, so you need its location to be relative  							to the working folder of the source repository.</li> 							<li>You want to develop against low-level APIes;  							therefore, you would like to beneficiate from the  							tracing facility and precondition checking that are  							absent from the release version.</li> 						</ol> 					  					<p>In both last cases, we recommend you generate native  					images of assemblies PostSharp.exe, PostSharp.Core.XmlSerializers.dll 					and PostSharp.Laos.Weaver.dll using the ngen utility.  					You can use fuslogvw to check that native images are used.</p> 					<p>There are two variants of the binary package:</p> 					<ul> 						<li><strong>Debug</strong>: Contains the tracing  						facility, the precondition checks, and is of course  						compiled in debug mode and comes with debugging symbols.  						Use this version if you plan to use the low-level APIes or 						if you are requested to do so in order to diagnose a bug.</li> 						<li><strong>Release</strong>: This version is  						recommended for common users of PostSharp.</li> 					</ul> 					  					<h2>Source Package</h2> 					<p>This package contains the source code (!). Download it if  					you want to know how it works.</p> 					<p>The source code does not contain the private key. If you  					want to build the product on your own, you will need to  					provide your own keys and so some minor modifications in  					source code (replace our public key token by your).</p>
