<h1>Login and Registration Problems</h1><p>So you have problems registering or logging into our website?</p><p>The following tips usually help:</p><ol><li><strong>Check your spam box. </strong>You should have received an activation email. You will not be able to sign in until you follow the URL contained in this email.</li><li><strong>Wait 5 minutes</strong>. As a spam protection, some email providers require the activation email to be resent after a few minutes. So be patient!</li><li><strong>VerifyÂ your password</strong>. Because of a bug in the Joomla/PHPBB software we use, passwords cannot contain non-ASCII characters. <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/forum/ucp.php?mode=sendpassword">Reset your password</a> if necessary.</li></ol><p>If you still have problems, don't contact us at <a href="mailto:login@postsharp.org">login@postsharp.org</a>. Don't forget to tell us the login and email address you used during registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
