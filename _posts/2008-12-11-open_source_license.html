<h1>Open Source License <br /></h1><p> <em>Run-time</em> components of PostSharp (<em>PostSharp.Public.dll</em>, <em> PostSharp.Laos.dll</em>) are released under GNU Lesser General Public License  (LGPL) version 3<em>, </em> but <em>compile-time</em> parts (all other libraries) are released under the GNU General     Public License (GPL) version 3.  </p> <p>Therefore, if you use PostSharp to make a program for end-users, you don't need to release it as open source. However, if your product uses PostSharp to modify programs of your customers (which means that you would typically need to include <em>PostSharp.Core.dll</em> in your  distribution package), you have either to publish it     as open source, or to buy a commercial license.</p>     <p> Note that, by exception to GPL, you may use link PostSharp compile-time to modules released under any OSI-approved license.</p>                        <p>In other words:</p> <ul><li>Programs transformed by PostSharp are never subject to license restrictions because they are linked only to LGPL components, which is not a viral license.</li><li>Aspect libraries written for PostSharp Laos are not subject to license restriction. However, if you develop new abstract aspect with their own weaver (i.e. you typically reference <em>PostSharp.Laos.Weaver.dll</em>),  	you are subject to license restrictions.</li><li>If you develop a plug-in to PostSharp, or make a program using PostSharp low-level APIes, you should release it under GPL or one of the other supported open-source licenses.</li></ul>  <div style="margin: 15px; font-size: smaller; background-color: #eeeeee"> <h1>Open-Source License Agreement for PostSharp</h1> 	<p>THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT  	(“OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR POSTSHARP”) OR THE COMMERCIAL LICENSE  	AGREEMENT FOR POSTSHARP. YOU, AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR A LEGAL ENTITY, CAN USE  	THE SOFTWARE UNDER ONE OF THESE LICENSE AGREEMENTS ONLY. IF YOU USE THE  	SOFTWARE UNDER THE COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT, USING THE SOFTWARE UNDER  	THE OPEN-SOURCE LICENSE AGREEMENT WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT TO THE COMMERCIAL  	LICENSE AGREEMENT.</p> 	<h2> 1. Parties</h2> 	<p>(a) "Licensor" means Gael Fraiteur, having its  	principal place of business at Lutovitova 932, Kralupy nad Vltavou, 27801,  	Czech Republic.</p> 	<p>(b) "Licensee" means any individual or organization  	using the Program.</p> 	<h2>2. Definitions</h2> 	<p>(a) “Program” means software program known as PostSharp  	in binary or source code form, but not including its installer package, user  	documentation, and samples.</p> 	<p>(b) “Public Components” means the libraries  	PostSharp.Public and PostSharp.Laos.</p> 	<p>(c) “Open-Source Software” is any program or library  	released under a license recognized by the Open Source Initiative.</p> 	<p>(d) “Closed-Source Software” is any program or library  	that is not Open-Source Software.</p> 	<h2>3. Licensing of Public Components</h2> 	<p>Public Components are free software; you can  	redistribute them and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU Lesser  	General Public License, version 3.</p> 	<p>Linking other modules to run-time libraries of  	PostSharp does not affect licensing terms of these modules. However, some  	other requirements apply. See the 	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General  	Public License</a> for more details. </p> 	<h2>4. Licensing of the Program</h2> 	<p>The Program is free software; you can redistribute it  	and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version  	3. </p> 	<h3>4.1. Interpretation of “Covered Work”</h3> 	<p>Linking other modules statically or dynamically,  	directly or indirectly, with compile-time libraries of the Program is making  	a combined work based on the Program. Thus, the terms and conditions of the 	<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU General Public  	License</a> cover the whole combination. </p> 	<p>“Linking” is shall not be understood in a technical  	meaning, but in a functional meaning: if a component requires the Program to  	fulfill its function, it is considered as being linked to it.</p> 	<p>“Linking” is transitive: if a component denoted A is  	linked to another component denoted B, and component B is linked to the  	Program, it is considered that component A is linked to the Program.</p> 	<h3>4.2. Additional Permissions</h3> 	<p>In addition, as a special exception to the GPL v3, the  	Licensor gives you permission to combine the Program with any Open-Source  	Software. You may copy and distribute an Open-Source Software combined with  	the Program following the terms of the GNU GPL and the licenses of the other  	code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code  	when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.</p> 	<p>Note that people who make modified versions of the  	Program are not obligated to grant these special exceptions for their  	modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General  	Public License gives permission to release a modified version without this  	exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified  	version which carries forward this exception.</p> 	<h3>4.3. Additional Restrictions</h3> 	<p>(a) If you convey a  	modified copy of the covered work, you must clearly specify the origin of  	the material.</p> 	<p>(b) Under trademark laws,  	if you convey a modified copy of the covered work, you cannot use the word  	'PostSharp' in the name of your new product. </p> 	<h2>5. Licensing of the Installer Package and the User Documentation</h2> 	<p>The Licensor grants the Licensee an unlimited  	permission to use the unmodified Installer Package and User Documentation.</p> 	<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Installer Package  	or User Documentation as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  	copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License apply to  	the program; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and  	give all recipients a copy of this License along with the software.</p> 	<h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h2> 	<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT  	PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE  	COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT  	WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT  	LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A  	PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE  	PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST  	OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p> 	<h2><a name="section16" title="section16"></a>7. Limitation of Liability.</h2> 	<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED  	TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES  	AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING  	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO  	LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR  	THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER  	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE  	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p> 	<p><a href="mailto:gael@fraiteur.net"><br /></a></p> </div>
