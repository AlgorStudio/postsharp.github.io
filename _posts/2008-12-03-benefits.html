<h1>Benefits</h1> <p>Why would you want to add another tool in the already-complex     development environment of your team? The ultimate reason is: it will <strong>    reduce development and maintenance cost </strong>of your applications. Let's     see how.</p> <h2>Less of Lines of Code</h2> <p>Every line of code is a source of complexity and a potential source of     problem. Every line of code costs money. Therefore, every line of code that     does not contribute directly to the core concern of the program should be     considered with great attention.</p> <p><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong> like transaction management,     tracing, security, and exception handling, rarely add business value to the     program. They are nevertheless important, since unreliable programs are of no     business value at all.</p> <p>As they are typically implemented by the repetition of the same pattern for     the dozens and dozens of methods to which they apply, non-functional     requirements generally result in numerous lines of codes.</p> <p>With aspect-oriented programming, you can <strong>address non-functional     requirements declaratively </strong>and simply remove these bad and expensive     lines from your code.</p> <h2>Better Design</h2> <p>The problem with non-functional requirements is that their implementation is     mangled in all methods implementing functional requirements. This severely     violates the established principle of <strong>separation of concerns</strong>.     With aspect-oriented programming, you could:</p> <ul>    <li><strong>Improve feature localization</strong>: the implementation of     transaction handling will be located in the transaction handling aspect, not     in every business method.</li>    <li><strong>Reduce component coupling</strong>: business code will not be     directly coupled to the transaction handling implementation any more; it will     be easier to change the transaction handler for another.</li>    <li><strong>Improve skill set consistency in     your team</strong>: a domain expert will not have to care about how to     implement properly caching in a multithreaded context any more; he will just     declare the business method cacheable.</li> </ul> <h2>Automate Pattern Implementation</h2> <p>Implementation Patterns are best practices learned by the community through     experience. Patterns are often formalized in natural language as 'recipes'     giving a solution to a given problem.</p> <p>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) makes it possible to encapsulate some of     the best practices into executable code: instead of suggesting how to     implement correctly exception handling, you may make a custom attribute out     of it, and let it available to the team.</p>
