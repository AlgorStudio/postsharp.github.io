I've just put online a <a href="http://postsharp.sourceforge.net/simple-trace-tutorial.htm">flash tutorial</a> that shows how to create a Trace aspect using PostSharp Laos. I know, people that read my blog probably already master this trivial example...

Comments are welcome. A question I ask to myself is: what is better? A Flash tutorial or a screen capture video with comments in my Belgian accent? If you have an opinion about this, please share it :-)
