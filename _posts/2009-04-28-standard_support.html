<h1>Standard Support</h1><div class="tip">All commercial customers automatically get access to standard support. </div><h2>Features</h2><ul><li><strong>E-mail Based</strong>: An email client is all you need to create a support case. </li><li><strong>CRM-backed</strong>: We use professional CRM software to track support cases and monitor our quality of service. You immediately get a notification that we received your case.</li><li><strong>Quick Answer</strong>: We will struggle to answer you as soon as possible. Most of the time, especially if you reside in EMEA longitudes, expect the response time to be in hours.</li><li><strong>Priority Issue Fixes</strong>: Commercial customers can escalate issues that have been reported (by others or themselves) in the <a href="http://www.postsharp.org/tracker">issue tracker</a>. From that moment, we will solve the issue with high priority and publish a special build in short delays.</li></ul><h2>Coverage</h2><p>Standard support covers the following topics:</p><ul><li><strong>Installation</strong> of PostSharp and <strong>integration</strong> into build environments.</li><li>Use of <strong>PostSharp Laos</strong>.</li></ul>Because of the intrinsic complexity of PostSharp Core and MSIL, standard support does not cover these topics. Please acquire some <a href="support/gold-support">gold support time</a> if you require assistance on these topics.<br /><h2>Contact</h2><p>If you need to contact our support team, all you need is to send a mail to support@codingglove.com. You should receive an automated notification within 15 minutes. If you don't, it may be that we didn't receive your request because of spam filters, or because we could not reach your mailbox. If you receive the notification, it means that your request has been recorded in our backoffice and it's now our responsibility so help you! </p><div class="alert">We only accept support requests from registered customers. Learn how to <a href="support/supported-customer">register your address or the one of your team members</a>.</div>
