<h1>Policy Injection</h1>
<div>
	<p>The term <strong>Policy Injection</strong> has been introduced recently by 
	the Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices Team (see the blog of
	<span>
	<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez/archive/2007/02/23/policy-injection-app-block-behind-the-scenes.aspx">
	Ed Jeziersky</a></span> and <span>
	<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2007/02/23/announcing-the-policy-injection-application-block.aspx">
	Tom Hollander</a></span>) to designate what is fundamentally Aspect-Oriented 
	Programming.</p>
	<p>When asked why the name <strong>Policy Injection</strong> and not <strong>
	AOP</strong>, Ed answers:</p>
	<blockquote>
		... the reality is most of our customers have not heard of AOP or AOSD. 
		Please put yourself in their shoes for a second. We wanted a name that was 
		reflective of the use and benefit the block brings, rather than using an 
		unfamiliar term that only the exceptions understand. We also wanted to have 
		no implicit expectations on the design that may be inherited from AO solutions.</blockquote>
	<p>So <strong>Policy Injection</strong> is AOP, or at least a part of it. The 
	reason why Microsoft did not choose the term AOP seems to be that AOP could 
	have been perceived as a boring academic concept, which was fashionable in the 
	.NET community about year 2003.</p>
